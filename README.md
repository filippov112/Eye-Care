# Eye Care

Theme for Obsidian.

Theme features:
- The standard theme is used as a basis, in which color combinations have been changed in order to improve contrast where it was lacking and reduce it in places where it caused discomfort.
- The accent color of the theme is configured via a global parameter (as in the default theme).
- Scaling via `Ctrl+scroll` affects not only the text of the note itself, but also the font of the entire application interface.
