# Eye Care

Theme for Obsidian.

Theme features:
- The width of the note container is stretched to 100% of the window width.
- The standard theme is used as a basis, in which the color combinations are changed in order to improve contrast where it was lacking and reduce it in places where it caused discomfort.
- The accent color of the theme is configured via a global parameter (as in the default theme).
- Scaling via `Ctrl+scroll` affects not only the text of the note itself, but also the font of the entire application interface.
